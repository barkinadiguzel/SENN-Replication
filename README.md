# SENN-Replication
SENN-Replication is a minimal PyTorch implementation of Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENN) focused on translating the theoretical model into a working architecture. The goal is not benchmarking, but building a faithful prototype that exposes concepts, relevance scores, and intrinsic explanations by design.
